Introduction
-------------------------

Test code, demonstrates the use of hash-rings in a pub-sub system to distribute subscriptions. This project is purely an exercise in testing a hash-ring on a pseudo distributed system (peers in cluster are objects not processes - as are clients)

To run the example tests, which explain how the setup works:

```
git clone
```
